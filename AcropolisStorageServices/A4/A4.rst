Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is a peer authentication protocol that allows an iSCSI client and target to authenticate based on a password, also referred to as a secret. 

CHAP includes both one-way and mutual authentication. With one-way CHAP, a target authenticates a client initiator when it connects.

With mutual CHAP, the client and the target authenticate each other based on their respective passwords. Volumes supports using both one-way and mutual CHAPs.
