Exam tips and tricks
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Taking the exam

- The exam is delivered online with a live proctor 
  
  - Proctors usually contact you within 15 minutes of exam launch but in some cases take much longer

  - You need a computer with a camera and mic.

  - You will need a current government ID with the same name as the one used to schedule the exam
  - Clear your desk and work area - you will be asked to pan your camera around to make sure your area is clear
  - If you have multiple monitors you need to disable all but one to start the exam.
  - Make sure you are ready to sit for up to two hours
  - Exams must be canceled or rescheduled 48 hours before the scheduled appointment time.

..  

- Normal exam processes apply

  - Read each question and the possible responses carefully
  
    - Read all possible answers even if you think the first one is correct
	
  - If something isn't mentioned, consider it set to the default.
  - If the right answer isn't obvious, start eliminating the wrong answers
  
    - Then compare the answers that remain.  Choosing 1 of 2 has a better chance of success than 1 of 4.

  - If you are not sure, flag the question and come back to it later.
  
  - The answers are in random order - always choosing "C" is not a viable strategy.
  
  - Take your time.  You have over 90 seconds per question on average.  Use them to read and answer carefully.

    - Some questions (questions requiring matching) will take longer than others
    - All questions have the same value
