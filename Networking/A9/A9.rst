MTU = Max. Transmission Unit
The standard 1,500 byte MTU still delivers excellent performance, but increasing the MTU can be beneficial in  some scenarios. 
Jumbo frames are Ethernet frames with more than 1500 bytes of payload.
For example, you can configure jumbo frames in your network when using Nutanix Volumes to connect high-performance external servers to Nutanix volume groups over iSCSI. This configuration increases efficiency for applications such as databases connecting to Volumes.
