Crash-consistent means the snapshot captures all of the VMâ€™s data at exactly the same time.
Crash-consistent backups don't work nearly as well for database applications because they do not capture data in memory or any pending I/O operations. As such, restoring from a crash-consistent backup requires extra work, such as journaling forward, before an application can be brought back online.

In addition to providing a crash-consistent backup, application-consistent backups also capture all data in memory and all transactions in process. This is performed by using some type of client software co-resident with the database application or, in the case of Microsoft Windows and Hyper-V, the VSS API, to quiesce the database application, flush its memory cache, complete all its writes in order and then perform the backup. When the backup or snapshot is complete, the software notifies the database application to resume. A restoration of an application-consistent backup requires no additional work to restore the database application.
