Welcome to the Nutanix Certified Professional - Multicloud Infrastructure 5.15 Exam Prep Workshop.  The NCP-MCI 5.15 certification validates your skills and abilities in deploying, administering, and troubleshooting AOS 5.15.

This short workshop is intended to provide a highlight of the NCP exam including briefly discussing the objectives covered by the exam and reviewing practice questions. This is intended to supplement the Enterprise Cloud Administration training course, hopefully you have already attended that course with an instructor or reviewed the modules at Nutanix University.

At the end of the workshop you will know how to sign up to the exam, be armed with the testing details, have a solid overview of the topics on the exam and be familiar with the question format.
